## Introduction

This project is a friendly chatbot implemented using a neural network and the bag-of-words method for pattern encoding. The chatbot is trained to recognize user intents and provide friendly responses based on the trained model. It includes a simple interface for easy interaction.
   
## Features

- **Friendly Chatbot:** Provides friendly responses to user queries.
- **Neural Network:** Utilizes a neural network for pattern recognition and response generation.
- **Bag-of-Words Encoding:** Encodes input patterns using the bag-of-words method for training.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following libraries:

- json
- nltk
- numpy
- random
- string
- tensorflow
- Additionally, download the NLTK data : nltk.download("punkt"), nltk.download("wordnet")

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in ChatBot folder.
2. Install all the libraries and download the data mentioned under the requirements title.
3. Run all cells and from the final cell, chat with the bot.
