# Chatbot with Neural Network

This project is a simple and friendly chatbot built using a neural network. It uses a JSON file to get intents, lemmatizes and tokenizes the data to create vocabularies, encodes patterns using the bag-of-words method, and trains a neural network to recognize intents and respond accordingly.

## Features

- Load intents from a JSON file
- Lemmatize and tokenize data to create vocabularies
